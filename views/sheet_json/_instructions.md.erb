# Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) Tabbed Character Sheet
 This sheet has a pared down 0-level Player sheet, a Level 1+ Player sheet and a Monster Sheet for the GM that are switchable via a tab at the top left of the sheet.

* If you are currently using the original DCC sheet, it is recommended to make a copy of the campaign before switching to the new sheet.  The same variables were used whenever possible, but repeating sections data will not transfer at this time (I hope to add this feature).

## Player Sheets

* Most rolls should have Roll Templates.
* Includes Core, Crawl and Crawling Under a Broken Moon classes.
* For Thieves, you can use the old Beta % based rolls (per Claytonian JP's request)
* Lucky rolls are included within rolls automatically whenever possible.
* Roll Template Backgrounds based on the kind of rolls you are making.
* Criticals and Fumbles are rolled automatically based on the d20 roll.

## Monster Sheet

* Monster Rolls have Roll Templates.
* Certain rolls only go to GM
* Melee and Ranged Attacks include Special attack ability
* Criticals and Fumbles are rolled automatically based on the d20 roll.

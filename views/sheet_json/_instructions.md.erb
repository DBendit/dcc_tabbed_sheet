# Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) Tabbed Character Sheet
This sheet has a pared down 0-level player sheet, a sheet for multiple Level 0s, a Level 1+ player sheet and a monster sheet for the Judge that are switchable via a tab at the top left of the sheet.

* If you are currently using the original DCC sheet, it is recommended to make a copy of the campaign before switching to the new sheet. You can then press the import button on the options section to import the data from the original sheet.

* Most rolls should have Roll Templates.
* Includes Core, Crawl and Crawling Under a Broken Moon classes.
* For Thieves, you can use the old Beta % based rolls (per Claytonian JP's request)
* Lucky rolls are included within rolls automatically whenever possible.
* Roll Template Backgrounds based on the kind of rolls you are making.
* Criticals and Fumbles are rolled automatically based on the d20 roll.

## Monster Sheet

* Monster Rolls have Roll Templates.
* Certain rolls only go to GM
* Melee and Ranged Attacks include Special attack ability
* Criticals and Fumbles are rolled automatically based on the d20 roll.
